Smart Bookmark App
A modern bookmark manager built with Next.js, Supabase, and custom CSS.

Features
✅ Google OAuth authentication
✅ Add bookmarks with title and URL
✅ Private bookmarks per user (RLS policies)
✅ Real-time updates across tabs
✅ Delete bookmarks
✅ Modern, responsive UI with animations
🛠️ Problems Faced & Solutions
1. Duplicate Key Error (409 Conflict)
Problem: Getting "duplicate key violates unique constraint" when adding bookmarks Solution: Realized UUID wasn't auto-generating. Fixed by ensuring database uses gen_random_uuid() as default for id column.

2. RLS Policy Issues
Problem: Users could see all bookmarks or none at all Solution: Implemented proper policies with auth.uid() = user_id for SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE operations.

3. Real-time Updates Not Working
Problem: Bookmarks wouldn't update across different browser tabs Solution: Added Supabase real-time subscription with proper channel configuration and cleanup in useEffect.

4. URL Formatting Errors
Problem: Bookmarks without https:// wouldn't open correctly Solution: Added automatic https:// prefix if no protocol specified.

5. Vercel Deployment Failures
Problem: Build failing with "supabaseUrl is required" Solution: Added environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in Vercel dashboard.

6. 400 Bad Request Error
Problem: column bookmarks.created_at does not exist Solution: Added created_at column to database or removed order by clause.
